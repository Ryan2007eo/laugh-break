I've created a simple, cheerful page designed specifically for screen workers who need a quick laugh break! Here's what it does:

Instant laughs: Opens with a dad joke that's guaranteed to get at least a groan-smile
One-click refresh: Click anywhere on the page to get a new joke and emoji
Visual fun: Bouncing emojis, floating animations, and smooth transitions
Zero cognitive load: No reading menus, no decisions to make - just pure, simple entertainment
Screen-worker friendly: Bright, cheerful design that's easy on tired eyes

The jokes are all clean, quick-to-read dad jokes and puns that hit that sweet spot of "so bad they're good." Perfect for that 1-second mental break that actually turns into a 30-second smile break!
